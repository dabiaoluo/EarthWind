# EarthWind
This is a dead-simple Android app that wraps earth.nullschool.net to use it as a screensaver. It is not published in the Play Store, but you can grab the latest apk file [here](https://github.com/firekesti/EarthWind/releases/download/1.0/app-release.apk) or from the Releases page.

It uses Immersive Mode on KitKat and up so that the "earth" button can be tapped more easily.
